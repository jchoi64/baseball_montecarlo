This program is designed to test the optimal batting lineup for producing
the most runs per game using Monte Carlo simulations. This program uses 
purely the offensive stats of the hitting team and ignores the defending team*.
*May change in future versions*

FOR INSTALLATION:
Run MyAppInstaller_web and follow instructions.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
When opening the program, it will take around a minute to load all the batter data.
Input batter names, # of iterations and # of innings and then press simulate. You can use sample team for a working example.

TIPS:
Keep iterations under 10000 as the program takes a long time for iterations over 10000.
Source code is included with the program. MCSim_GUI contains the files the program is based off and
MCSim_old contains the files which can be run on the Matlab prompt.
If you have Matlab installed, you can manually run the GUI by typing "guide" in the prompt and choosing the fig file from the source code.
