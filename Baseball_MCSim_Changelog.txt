CHANGELOG

Version 1:
-Initial code base which calculates if a batter strikes out, walks or hits and is able to determine if the hit is a single, double, triple or HR
-Player stats included on main file but will later be moved
Future Plans:
-Add base state (ex. runner on first and third or bases loaded etc.)
-Study more info on location of hits
-Add run counter

Version 2:
-Added function file "UpdateBases" which determines the state of the bases after a hit or walk
-Score, RBIs and Runs can now be counted
Future Plans:
-Determine if out was from groundball, strikeout or flyball
-Update bases accordingly from the type of out

**1ST WORKING VERSION**
Version 3:
-Outs can now be determined as a groundball, flyball or strikeout
-Updated function file "UpdateBases" to determine the state of the bases after an out
Future Plans:
-Revise assumptions
-Revise player stats to use BA to be more user-friendly
-Setup code to simulate a game against an opponent and find win rate

**2ND WORKING VERSION** 
Version 4:
-Player data is now calculated through the "Readexcel" function file
-Able to pull data from any batter as long as they were not traded mid season
Future Plans:
-Revise assumptions
-Setup code to simulate a game against an opponent
-Prompt user for input for batters
-Able to pull batter data from players traded mid season
-Make .exe file so others can use
-Find database for groundouts/flyouts
-Seperate score sheet for each game instead of accumulating the data (easier for stat analysis)

**3RD WORKING VERSION**
Version GUI:
-Code overhaul to support GUI:
-Main file changed to function file
-Score sheet now also keeps record of each game and not just the accumulation of all iterations (currently not used but may be used later for stat analysis)
-Batter excel file is pre loaded when GUI is run to save on run time
-Standard deviation and histogram is created for runs
-Still not able to pull data from players traded mid season
Future Plans:
-Revise assumptions
-Setup code to simulate a game against an opponent
-Able to pull batter data from players traded mid season (maybe accumulate player stats for the whole year or find a way to seperate)
-Find database for groundouts/flyouts


Overall Plans:
-Pitching/defense can be accounted for
-Statistical analysis (distribution curves,% of perfect/no hitter etc.)
-Run squared win-rate vs real win-rate
